# PsyTrack_Analysis
PsyTrack is a unique Python library provides a dynamic model for time-varying sensory decision-making behavior. 
Visualize changes in behavioral strategies of mice, rats, and humans across training
(developed by Roy, N. A., Bak, J. H., Laboratory, T. I. B., Akrami, A., Brody, C. D., & Pillow, J. W. (2021)
allows flexible method for inferring the trajectory of sensory decision-making strategies from choice data.
We apply PsyTrack to training data from mice, rats, and human subjects learning to perform auditory and visual decision-making tasks.
